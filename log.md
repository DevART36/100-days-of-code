90 % completed in basic JS, learned JS loops: for,while and do-while. Learned loop nesting to iterate the elements of an array[]. The challenges are so damn hard but with patience and perseverance , I managed to solved it.  

**Thoughts** 

Using loops to access elements in an array is so confusing. Honestly , loops are one of the things in JS that is not easy to understand.
